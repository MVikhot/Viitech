          <h4>Android 10 release, know about its new features</h4>
            <img class="news" src="img/android.jpg" alt="android">
            <br>
         <p>Android 10 has been released for all Pixel phones. Pixel 3, Pixel 3 XL, Pixel 3a, Pixel 3a XL, Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL, Pixel, and Pixel XL have started
            receiving Android 10 updates. Users can wait for the roll-out of Over the Air update if they want. You also have the option to sideload OTA update files.
            Remember that Android 10 was introduced in March this year in the name of the Android Q Beta program. With the latest software version, Google decided to
            change the 10-year history in which the company used Android’s name as Desert. Now the latest software is being called as Android 10. Google claims that by
            changing the name, it wants to make its product easier for global users to understand.
            Now that Android 10 has been released. Let’s take a look at the new features coming with it …
         </p>
            <p>Android 10: How to download, install</p>
            <p>
            If you have a Pixel smartphone, you can wait for Android 10 OTA update, or check the new update in Settings> System> System updates. Google has also published files
            of Android 10 OTA update. You can find the update files by clicking here. You can download these files on the pixel phone and download them. Even though this OTA update
            method will not erase your data. But we would suggest you to make a backup.
            Pixel phone users can flash the entire ROM in their phones by visiting the Android 10 factory image page. By doing this all the data will be erased.
            That is, it would be extremely important to back up the data before flashing.
            </p>
            <p>Top features of Android 10</p>
            <p>
            It was announced in Dark Theme I / O 2019 itself that Android 10 comes with System-Wide Thark Theme. This reduces eye strain and also saves battery life.
            Users can activate the system-wide dark theme by going to Settings> Display. It can also be activated by turning on the new Quick Settings tile or battery saver.
            Apart from changing the system UI to dark, the supporting apps will also show the new dark theme.

            <p>And for better privacy controls</p>
             Android 10 brings a new privacy section in Settings. This section comes with options such as activity controls,
             location history and add settings. It also comes with many new features. You will be able to decide app location permissions. Access to data through the app can be
             controlled through scoped storage.
             The privacy feature also has a restriction on launching unwanted apps in the background. This has been done to curb tracking.
            <p>Location Controls</p>
            Android 10 comes with enhanced location controls. In this, users get the opportunity to control access to the device’s location on the apps.
            There will be many options – forever, never or when the app is open.
            <p>Focus Mode</p>
            Focus Mode is the new Android feature that will also be made available for Android Pie users. The new feature is part of the company’s digital wellbeing program.
            Focus mode allows users to silence the apps they want. The new mode can be activated and activated via the quick toggle.
            <p>Live caption</p>
            Live Caption is probably the most interesting feature of Android 10. Live Caption has been made part of Android 10, using the captioning technology developed for YouTube.
            Now the operating system itself will write captions in audio messages, videos, podcasts and many other apps. This feature is very useful for those who like to watch videos
            on mute and who have difficulty listening.
