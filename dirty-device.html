            <img class="news" src="img/dirty-device.jpg" alt="dirty-device">
            <br>
            <p>Most people are not in a position that they can regularly afford to replace their devices, so that is the main reason to take good care of them.
            Just one cup of coffee spilling onto your laptop can fry it, one drop of your tablet while streaming your favorite movie and that could be the end of it.
            Simply loosing the grip on your expensive smart phone and it can plunge to its death. However, in this article you will find the most common mistakes that
            persons make that can threaten the life of their devices.
</p>
            <p>1. Being Cheap
            </p>
            <p>Many persons are unaware that the specific charger and cable that is included in the box with your device is specifically designed for that particular
            product. If you have the unfortunate experience of losing your charger or the cable becoming frayed for some reason, do not just buy a cheap lightning cable,
            that can negatively impact the performance of your device. More often than not these one-size-fits all chargers do not have the proper voltage needed to work
            with your specific device.
            </p>
            <p>2. Overcharging
            </p>
            <p>Although it might appear to be at odds because of the high-quality lithium-ion or lithium-polymer that batteries are made form, overcharging your
             battery may eventually damage your device. Batteries that have a high charge are under considerably more stress than batteries that are charged within
             the rule of thumb of between 40 percent to 80 percent. Laptops typically have charge-discharge cycles and consistently allowing your device to run flat
             can negatively affect this can the lifespan of the device.
            </p>
            <p>3. Consistently Charging
            </p>
            <p>Fortunately for us, the new generation devices such as laptops, smartphones and tablets have mechanisms in place to prevent excess charging.
            Keeping your device charging all through the night might not be regarded as harmful, it is recommended that you rest the device periodically and
            power it off sometimes. The device’s performance gets a huge boost from a power off, power on cycle.
            </p>
            <p>4. Being Inattentive
            </p>
            <p>The new generation device are made pretty sturdy, but dropping them is not the only concern. Leaving your device in a hot car or out in
            the sun can cause serious damage. More than just leaking or overheating the data on the device can end up lost of corrupted. Low quality
            batteries can also be extremely dangerous, they can overheat and even explode. Extreme cold can also be an issue as it can prevent the
            Lithium-ion batteries from discharging electricity.
            </p>
            <p>5. Dirty Devices
            </p>
            <p>These things are very useful for the cleaning of your devices. Compressed air – very useful for getting dirt out of very small
             crevices that are practically unreachable. Isopropyl alcohol – Household cleaning products are not suitable for cleaning your electronics,
             they are too harsh, so no using Windex or All Purpose Cleaners to clean your computer or gadgets. Distilled or purified bottled water –
             normal tap water can leave mineral spots and stains. Soft cloths that are lint free are best. Toothbrush – A soft toothbrush can be used on harder-to-reach areas.
