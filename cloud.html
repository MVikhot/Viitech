           <h4>5 Reasons Investing In Cloud Storage Works</h4>
            <img class="news" src="img/cloud-storage.jpg" alt="cloud-storage">
            <br>
            <p>Some cloud services offers a few gigabytes for free, but after about one year there is a service charge that is applied
            monthly to have an increased amount of storage or for use of the service.
</p>
            <p>1. Offsite Protection
            </p>
            <p>Google Drive, iCloud, OneDrive and Dropbox are all examples of cloud services that offer protection of your data from local
            physical threats like fire, flood, theft, power surges, viruses and even hard drive failure. A burglar that takes your laptop or
            tablets, may also get your hard drive, unless it is stored in another location; floods and fires can damage or even completely
            destroy your devices along with your external hard drive, if they are in the same location.
            </p>
            <p>2. Access From Anywhere
            </p>
            <p>Documents, photos, videos, which have been backed up to a cloud service can be retrieved from anywhere in the world that there
            is an internet connection and computer system, tablet or smartphone. Free apps are available for most cloud services which makes
            retrieving your data much easier from your mobile device.
            </p>
            <p>3. Sharing Information
            </p>
            <p>Instead of attempting to email large quantities or large files of photos or videos, which can inevitably clog your outbox and
            their inbox, cloud computing can resolve this by reducing the congestion. All that is required is for you to upload the files to
            the cloud storage, then send the intended receiver the link that is associated with those files for them to download and view.
            </p>
            <p>4. Real-time Collaboration
            </p>
            <p>Cloud computing enables persons, in particular students and co-workers, to simultaneously work on projects in real time,
            even if in completely different geographical locations. Two or more employees can collaborate on a project together and see each
            otherâ€™s ideas, instead of sending revisions back and forth to each other.
            </p>
            <p>5. Right Price
            </p>
            <p>Most consumer based cloud service companies offers storage of around 10 to 15 gigabytes for free, only Dropbox offers less.
            This capacity is usually adequate for most users, or they can create multiple account and access more storage that way if not
            satisfied with the initial amount. Other than that, there is a cost for additional capacity on each account and the price varies
            based on your requirements.
